An Obsidian theme designed to fit in with the Human Interface Guidelines.

**Pull requests are welcome if they are in line with the HIG.**

Note: the code isn't pretty and is presented as is

- [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
- Styling plugins to use:
  - [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) — turn on everything
  - [Icon Swapper](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-icon-swapper) — Import `icons.yml` to use the icons

### Still to do
- [ ] Mobile support
- [ ] More icons
- [ ] Menu styling
- [ ] Bugfixes
